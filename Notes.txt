8.2.2

1.  Define current_user method to find the user in the database corresponding to the session id.
	- Allows us to determin if a user is logged in
	- Allow for <%= current_user.name %>
	- Allow redirect to current_user	

	To do this we will need to find the current user. The "Find" method raises an error if the user is not found.
	But sometimes the users won't be logged in.  In that case we have to use a "find_by" method. 

	User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])

	Rather than raising an exception, this method return nil (indicating no such user) if the id is invalid.

	So our method would look like this

	def
		User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
	end

	This would hit the database multiple times if the current_user appeared multiple times on a page.  
	So lets store it in an instance variable.

	if @current_user.nil?
		@current_user = User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
	else
		@current_user
	end

	Using the or || operator 

	@current_user = @current_user || User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])

	User = nil or id

	A User object is true in a boolean context.  The call to find_by only gets executed if @current_user hasn't been assigned.

	This is how we'd write it in ruby...

	@current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
