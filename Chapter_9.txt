9.1.1 Editing User Information Form 

	Web browsers can't natively send put requests so the source html code includes a hiddin input field. 

	How does rails now to use a Post request for new users and a Put request for editing user data?
	- Active Record has a new_record? method that tells it when a new record is added to the database

	Post for new 
	Put for edit
